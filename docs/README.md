# Create-Portfolio-API Documentation
## Introduction
This is the documentation for the RESTful Create-Portfolio-API, which is intended to work alongside [Create-Portfolio](https://github.com/t0ri/create-portfolio-frontend) to fill your portfolioâ€™s data. 

The Create-Portfolio-API currently serves authorized access to a user's `project` data.

**Base URL**:  `create-portfolio.herokuapp.com/api`

``` json

	"title": "Project Name",
	"madeFor": "Class Name",
